📌 Recipe Style Guide

    Title & Subtitle

        Provide a clear dish name as the title.

        Use the subtitle to list:

            Serving suggestions (e.g., “Serve over rice or toast”)

            Garnishes or toppings (e.g., “Top with green onion or chili flakes”)

        Do not label it with the word “Subtitle.”

    Mise en Place (Ingredients List)

        Present as a bulleted list, with ingredients sorted in this order (but do not show category labels):

            Dry ingredients

            Liquid ingredients

            Vegetables

            Dairy

            Fresh herbs

            Onions

            Garlic

            Ginger

            Animal products (e.g., meat, eggs)

        Each bullet follows this format:
        Ingredient (Preparation) – Amount
        Example: Red Onion (Finely Diced) – 2 C or 1 large

        Use abbreviations for units where appropriate:
        tsp, TBSP, C, lb, etc.

        If an ingredient is used in more than one step with different quantities, list it separately for each use.

        Equivalents are formatted like:
        1 C or 2 sticks

        Group ingredients only if they are intentionally mixed before use (e.g., spice mix, marinade).

    Instructions

        Use a numbered list.

        Every step starts with a hook: a short, action-oriented summary of the step (e.g., “Toast the seeds.” “Add the garlic.”).

        If a time-based wait or action is included, begin a new step after it.

        Do not abbreviate units in this section (write “tablespoons,” not “TBSP”).

        Refer to ingredients using the shortest descriptive name necessary.

        If preheating the oven is required, this must be Step 1.

        Notes may be inserted between steps and must begin with NOTE: but are not numbered.
